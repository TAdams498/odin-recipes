    <h1>Dumplings with Sides</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Using Assi brand vegetable dumplings found at Lotte Plaza, this dish is quick and very savory. I eat mine with a soy sauce mix that I prepare, and I also try to include some sides as well to balance out the meal.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Assi brand vegetarian dumplings</li>
        <li>Corn starch</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Thai chiles</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Kimchi</li>
        <li>Pickled cabbage</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat</li>
        <li>When oil is warm, add as many frozen dumplings as desired, flat side down, and cover the pan, check periodically for golden brown underside</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, add a drop of sesame oil, it's important not to put too much otherwise the flavor will be overwhelmed</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce to the bowl, and a tiny bit of rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Stir in a spoonful of sugar to the sauce mix until dissolved, add more sugar if a thicker sauce is desired</li>
        <li>Chop up the thai chiles and scallions and mix them into the sauce bowl</li>
        <li>Mix corn starch and water into a small bowl to make a slurry</li>
        <li>When dumplings are golden brown on the bottom, add slurry to pan. Make sure it is evenly spread over the bottom of the pan and touching all of the dumplings</li>
        <li>Once corn starch mix has solidified, and the bottom of the dumplings looks brown enough, remove from pan</li>
        <li>Serve dumplings with sauce, rice, kimchi, and pickled cabbage on the side</li>
    </ol>
